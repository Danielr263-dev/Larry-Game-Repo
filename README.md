# Mindbreak RPG  
**By Team 19: Ivanna Donoso, Keilly Cespedes, Alexander Vallejos, and Daniel Rivera**

---

## Project Overview
Mindbreak is a pixel‑art psychological horror RPG built in Unity. You awaken with no memory in a derelict asylum, guided only by glitchy voices and flickering lights. Explore haunting hallways, collect fragments of your past, and face twisted “demons” in turn‑based combat—all while slowly uncovering the truth behind your own shattered mind.

## How to Run
To run the game, click the `MindbreakRPG.exe` file like normal—no special steps required.
